# Editorial

Classic magazine design, timeless typography

---

## Design Philosophy

The Editorial theme embodies:

- **Timeless elegance** - Inspired by The New Yorker and Esquire
- **Typography first** - Playfair Display meets Source Serif Pro
- **Restraint** - Single spot color used sparingly
- **Print heritage** - Fine rules, drop caps, pull quotes

---

## Typography

<!-- pause -->

Playfair Display for commanding headlines with classic serifs

<!-- pause -->

A refined palette of print conventions:
- Background: #ffffff (crisp white)
- Text: #000000 (true black)
- Accent: #7f1d1d (deep burgundy)

---

## Code Blocks

```typescript
class Magazine {
  private articles: Article[] = [];
  private layout: Layout;

  compose(content: Content): Spread {
    // Balance text and imagery with care
    const columns = this.layout.calculateColumns();
    return this.typeset(content, columns);
  }
}
```

Clean, minimal code styling with hairline borders.
