```python
class Expedition:
    """Field notes from the interior."""

    def __init__(self, destination):
        self.destination = destination
        self.discoveries = []
        self.supplies = {"quinine": 100, "compass": 1}

    def log_observation(self, specimen):
        # Record findings in field journal
        self.discoveries.append(specimen)
        return f"Specimen catalogued: {specimen}"
