# Origami Theme

The Art of Folded Paper

---

## The Paper Craft Aesthetic

Clean minimal design inspired by Japanese paper folding:

- **Pure white background** - Like crisp, pristine paper
- **Subtle shadows** - Creating depth and dimension
- **Geometric markers** - Triangles, diamonds, and squares
- **Quicksand typography** - Modern geometric sans-serif

---

## Design Philosophy

<!-- pause -->

Simplicity reveals beauty.

<!-- pause -->

Core principles of origami design:
- Background: #ffffff (pristine white)
- Typography: Quicksand geometric sans
- Accents: Blue, rose, emerald, amber, violet

## Code Blocks

```typescript
interface PaperFold {
  name: string;
  folds: number;
  difficulty: "beginner" | "intermediate" | "master";
  traditionalName?: string;
}

function createCrane(paper: PaperFold): string {
  const steps = calculateFolds(paper.folds);
  return steps.map(fold => executeFold(fold)).join(" → ");
}
```
