# Bauhaus Theme

Form follows function

---

## Design Philosophy

The Bauhaus movement revolutionized:

- **Geometric forms** - Circles, squares, triangles
- **Primary colors** - Red, yellow, blue only
- **Functional design** - No ornament without purpose
- **Unity of art** - Architecture, craft, and fine art as one

---

## Typography

<!-- pause -->

Bebas Neue for bold geometric headings

<!-- pause -->

Stark contrast with primary accents:
- Background: #ffffff (pure white)
- Text: #000000 (true black)
- Red: #e53935 | Yellow: #fdd835 | Blue: #1e88e5

---

## Code Blocks

```javascript
class BauhausGrid {
  constructor() {
    this.columns = 12;
    this.forms = ['circle', 'square', 'triangle'];
  }

  compose(elements) {
    // Geometry creates harmony
    return elements.map(el => ({
      form: this.forms[el.type],
      position: this.calculateGrid(el)
    }));
  }
}
```

Bold borders frame code with geometric precision.
