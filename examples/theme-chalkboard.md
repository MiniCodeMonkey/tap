# Chalkboard Theme

Lessons from the Classroom

---

## The Classroom Aesthetic

Friendly, educational design inspired by traditional blackboards:

- **Dark green slate** - Classic classroom chalkboard feel
- **Chalk colors** - White, yellow, pink, blue, green
- **Handwritten typography** - Caveat and Patrick Hand fonts
- **Chalk dust texture** - Realistic worn board effects

---

## Design Philosophy

<!-- pause -->

Teaching is an art written in chalk.

<!-- pause -->

Core principles of educational design:
- Background: #2d4a3e (dark green slate)
- Typography: Caveat for display, Patrick Hand for body
- Accents: Pastel chalk colors that pop against the dark board

---

## Code Blocks

```typescript
interface Lesson {
  subject: string;
  topic: string;
  duration: number;
  difficulty: "beginner" | "intermediate" | "advanced";
}

function writeOnBoard(lesson: Lesson): string {
  const chalk = selectChalkColor(lesson.difficulty);
  return `${chalk}: ${lesson.topic} - ${lesson.duration} minutes`;
}
```

Hand-drawn border effect with chalk dust smudges!

## Chalk Colors

The pastel palette brings warmth to education:

- Yellow highlights for emphasis
- Pink for important notes
- Blue for links and references
- Green for success indicators
- Orange for warnings and alerts

These colors evoke nostalgic classroom memories:

1. Spelling tests on the board
2. Math problems step by step
3. History timelines drawn in chalk
4. Science diagrams and formulas
5. Literature quotes and themes
