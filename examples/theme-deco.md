# Deco Theme

Gatsby-era glamour meets geometric luxury

---

## Design Philosophy

The Deco theme embodies:

- **Jazz Age elegance** - 1920s opulence and sophistication
- **Geometric precision** - Sunbursts, chevrons, and symmetry
- **Gold accents** - Luxurious metallic highlights
- **Bold contrast** - Deep black with cream and gold

---

## Typography

- Accent: #d4af37 (luxurious gold)

## Code Blocks

class GrandBallroom:
    """A celebration of art deco architecture."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.chandeliers = []
        self.gilt_details = ["sunburst", "chevron", "fan"]

    def illuminate(self, guests):
        # Light up the evening
        return self.sparkle_with_elegance(guests)
