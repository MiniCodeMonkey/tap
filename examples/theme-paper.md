# Paper Theme

Ultra-clean, premium, effortlessly elegant

## Design Philosophy

The Paper theme embodies:

- **Purity** - Clean white backgrounds like fresh paper
- **Clarity** - Near-black text with excellent contrast
- **Sophistication** - Warm accent tones, not cold
- **Focus** - Content takes center stage

---

## Typography

<!-- pause -->

**Inter / system-ui** font family throughout

<!-- pause -->

Confident letter-spacing (-0.02em) and perfect line heights:
- Titles: 8rem
- H1: 6rem
- H2: 4rem
- Body: 2rem

---

## Code Blocks

```typescript
interface Presentation {
  title: string;
  slides: Slide[];
  config: Config;
}

function createSlide(content: string): Slide {
  return { content, layout: 'default' };
}
```

Dark code blocks (#1e1e1e) with excellent contrast.
