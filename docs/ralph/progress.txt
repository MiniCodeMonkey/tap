# Ralph Progress Log
Started: Fri Jan 23 20:59:35 CET 2026

## Codebase Patterns
- VitePress config is at `docs/.vitepress/config.ts`
- Use `srcExclude: ['**/ralph/**']` to exclude development files from VitePress build
- VitePress validates TypeScript during build - no separate typecheck needed
- Build output goes to `docs/.vitepress/dist/`
- Dev server runs on port 5173 by default

## 2026-01-23 - US-001
- What was implemented: Initialized VitePress project with basic configuration
- Files changed:
  - `docs/.gitignore` (created) - Excludes node_modules, cache, dist
  - `docs/.vitepress/config.ts` (modified) - Added srcExclude for ralph directory
  - `docs/index.md` (existing) - Placeholder landing page
  - `docs/package.json` (existing) - Has VitePress dev dependency and scripts
  - `docs/package-lock.json` (existing) - Lock file
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - VitePress was already partially set up; needed to add srcExclude to prevent build errors from ralph directory
  - The build validates TypeScript, so a separate typecheck command is not required
  - Must add .gitignore early to avoid committing node_modules

## 2026-01-23 - US-002
- What was implemented: Configured navigation and sidebar structure in VitePress
- Files changed:
  - `docs/.vitepress/config.ts` - Added nav array with 5 links (Getting Started, Guide, Reference, Examples, GitHub) and sidebar configuration for /guide/, /reference/, and /examples/ sections
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - VitePress sidebar uses path-based matching - sidebar configs keyed by `/guide/` only show on pages under that path
  - The `items: []` in sidebar groups can be empty (useful for examples section placeholder)
  - Nav links to sections should point to the first page in that section (e.g., `/guide/writing-slides` not just `/guide/`)

## 2026-01-23 - US-003
- What was implemented: Created all stub markdown files for documentation structure
- Files changed:
  - `docs/getting-started.md` (created) - Getting started page stub
  - `docs/guide/writing-slides.md` (created) - Guide stub
  - `docs/guide/layouts.md` (created) - Guide stub
  - `docs/guide/themes.md` (created) - Guide stub
  - `docs/guide/animations-transitions.md` (created) - Guide stub
  - `docs/guide/code-blocks.md` (created) - Guide stub
  - `docs/guide/live-code-execution.md` (created) - Guide stub
  - `docs/guide/presenter-mode.md` (created) - Guide stub
  - `docs/guide/images-media.md` (created) - Guide stub
  - `docs/guide/building-export.md` (created) - Guide stub
  - `docs/reference/cli-commands.md` (created) - Reference stub
  - `docs/reference/frontmatter-options.md` (created) - Reference stub
  - `docs/reference/slide-directives.md` (created) - Reference stub
  - `docs/reference/layouts-reference.md` (created) - Reference stub
  - `docs/reference/drivers.md` (created) - Reference stub
  - `docs/reference/keyboard-shortcuts.md` (created) - Reference stub
  - `docs/examples/index.md` (created) - Examples section stub
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - All stub pages follow the same pattern: YAML frontmatter with title, H1 heading matching title, brief description, and "*Content coming soon.*" placeholder
  - Directory structure mirrors the sidebar navigation configured in US-002
  - File names use kebab-case and match the sidebar link paths
