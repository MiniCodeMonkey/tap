# Ralph Progress Log
Started: Fri Jan 23 20:59:35 CET 2026

## Codebase Patterns
- VitePress config is at `docs/.vitepress/config.ts`
- Use `srcExclude: ['**/ralph/**']` to exclude development files from VitePress build
- VitePress validates TypeScript during build - no separate typecheck needed
- Build output goes to `docs/.vitepress/dist/`
- Dev server runs on port 5173 by default
- Custom theme files go in `docs/.vitepress/theme/` (index.ts + style.css)
- VitePress CSS variables use `--vp-c-*` prefix for colors, `--vp-font-family-*` for fonts
- Vue components go in `docs/.vitepress/theme/components/` and are registered in theme index.ts via `app.component()`

---

## 2026-01-23 - US-001
- What was implemented: Initialized VitePress project with basic configuration
- Files changed:
  - `docs/.gitignore` (created) - Excludes node_modules, cache, dist
  - `docs/.vitepress/config.ts` (modified) - Added srcExclude for ralph directory
  - `docs/index.md` (existing) - Placeholder landing page
  - `docs/package.json` (existing) - Has VitePress dev dependency and scripts
  - `docs/package-lock.json` (existing) - Lock file
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - VitePress was already partially set up; needed to add srcExclude to prevent build errors from ralph directory
  - The build validates TypeScript, so a separate typecheck command is not required
  - Must add .gitignore early to avoid committing node_modules
---

## 2026-01-23 - US-002
- What was implemented: Configured navigation and sidebar structure in VitePress
- Files changed:
  - `docs/.vitepress/config.ts` - Added nav array with 5 links (Getting Started, Guide, Reference, Examples, GitHub) and sidebar configuration for /guide/, /reference/, and /examples/ sections
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - VitePress sidebar uses path-based matching - sidebar configs keyed by `/guide/` only show on pages under that path
  - The `items: []` in sidebar groups can be empty (useful for examples section placeholder)
  - Nav links to sections should point to the first page in that section (e.g., `/guide/writing-slides` not just `/guide/`)
---

## 2026-01-23 - US-003
- What was implemented: Created all stub markdown files for documentation structure
- Files changed:
  - `docs/getting-started.md` (created) - Getting started page stub
  - `docs/guide/writing-slides.md` (created) - Guide stub
  - `docs/guide/layouts.md` (created) - Guide stub
  - `docs/guide/themes.md` (created) - Guide stub
  - `docs/guide/animations-transitions.md` (created) - Guide stub
  - `docs/guide/code-blocks.md` (created) - Guide stub
  - `docs/guide/live-code-execution.md` (created) - Guide stub
  - `docs/guide/presenter-mode.md` (created) - Guide stub
  - `docs/guide/images-media.md` (created) - Guide stub
  - `docs/guide/building-export.md` (created) - Guide stub
  - `docs/reference/cli-commands.md` (created) - Reference stub
  - `docs/reference/frontmatter-options.md` (created) - Reference stub
  - `docs/reference/slide-directives.md` (created) - Reference stub
  - `docs/reference/layouts-reference.md` (created) - Reference stub
  - `docs/reference/drivers.md` (created) - Reference stub
  - `docs/reference/keyboard-shortcuts.md` (created) - Reference stub
  - `docs/examples/index.md` (created) - Examples section stub
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - All stub pages follow the same pattern: YAML frontmatter with title, H1 heading matching title, brief description, and "*Content coming soon.*" placeholder
  - Directory structure mirrors the sidebar navigation configured in US-002
  - File names use kebab-case and match the sidebar link paths
---

## 2026-01-23 - US-004
- What was implemented: Set up custom VitePress theme with Linear-inspired styling
- Files changed:
  - `docs/.vitepress/theme/index.ts` (created) - Theme entry point extending default theme
  - `docs/.vitepress/theme/style.css` (created) - Custom CSS variables for colors and fonts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - VitePress custom themes go in `docs/.vitepress/theme/` directory
  - Theme index.ts must import DefaultTheme from 'vitepress/theme' and export it
  - CSS variables use `--vp-c-*` naming convention (e.g., `--vp-c-brand-1`, `--vp-c-bg`, `--vp-c-text-1`)
  - Dark mode is activated via `.dark` class selector on the root element
  - Font stacks use `--vp-font-family-base` for body and `--vp-font-family-mono` for code
---

## 2026-01-23 - US-005
- What was implemented: Created HomeHero component for the landing page

  - `docs/.vitepress/theme/index.ts` (modified) - Registered HomeHero as a global component
  - `docs/index.md` (modified) - Changed layout to `page` and added HomeHero component
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Vue components must be registered globally in theme index.ts using `app.component()` within `enhanceApp()`
  - Use `extends: DefaultTheme` instead of just exporting DefaultTheme when adding enhancements
  - Components directory is `docs/.vitepress/theme/components/`
  - Use `layout: page` in frontmatter to have a clean page with just nav and content (no sidebar)
  - CSS scoped styles in Vue components keep styles isolated from the rest of the site
---

  - `docs/.vitepress/theme/index.ts` (modified) - Registered CopyButton as a global component
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup lang="ts">` is cleaner for simple components
  - Use `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` for clipboard operations (async API)
  - SVG icons can be inlined in Vue templates for simple icons (copy icon, checkmark icon)
  - Use `ref()` for reactive state that controls UI (e.g., copied state for icon toggle)
  - setTimeout is fine for simple temporary state changes like copy feedback

  - `docs/index.md` (modified) - Added HomeThemes component after HomeCode
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use CSS gradients for abstract theme previews (more lightweight than images)
  - 5-column grid works well for 5 items; use `repeat(5, 1fr)` for even distribution
  - Responsive breakpoints: 5 columns at desktop, 2 at tablet (900px), 1 at mobile (480px)
  - Hover effects with `translateY` and `box-shadow` add subtle interactivity

  - Mobile buttons should be full-width with `flex-direction: column` for better touch targets
  - Code blocks need `overflow-x: auto` which was already in place for horizontal scrolling
  - Reduce padding consistently across components on mobile (24px -> 16px)
  - Font sizes should scale down proportionally: desktop -> tablet -> mobile

- What was implemented: Added Netlify configuration file for deployment
- Files changed:
  - `netlify.toml` (created) - Netlify configuration with build command, publish directory, and SPA redirect rule
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Netlify config file goes in project root (not docs/ directory)
  - Use `base = "docs"` to specify the directory where build commands should run (since package.json is in docs/)
  - SPA redirect rule (`/* -> /index.html` with status 200) ensures client-side routing works for VitePress
  - Publish directory is relative to project root, so it's `docs/.vitepress/dist`
---

  - Search automatically indexes all pages and provides hierarchical navigation (e.g., "Page > Section > Subsection")
  - Search highlights matching terms in result previews
  - No additional dependencies or setup required - VitePress handles indexing at build time
---

## 2026-01-24 - US-032
- What was implemented: Added comprehensive SEO meta tags to VitePress configuration
- Files changed:
  - `docs/.vitepress/config.ts` (modified) - Added Open Graph tags, Twitter card tags, and canonical URL
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - VitePress SEO tags go in the `head` array in config as tuples: `['meta', { property: 'og:...', content: '...' }]`
  - Use constants for siteUrl, siteTitle, siteDescription to avoid duplication across meta tags
  - Open Graph uses `property` attribute (`og:title`), Twitter uses `name` attribute (`twitter:title`)
  - Canonical URL uses a link tag: `['link', { rel: 'canonical', href: siteUrl }]`
  - Twitter card type `summary_large_image` provides a larger preview than default `summary`
---

## 2026-01-24 - US-033
- What was implemented: Polished dark mode styling for the documentation site
- Files changed:
  - `docs/.vitepress/theme/style.css` (modified) - Added explicit divider color variables for both light mode (#e2e8f0) and dark mode (#334155)
  - `docs/.vitepress/theme/components/HomeThemes.vue` (modified) - Enhanced hover shadow for theme cards with darker shadow in dark mode
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Dark mode shadows need to be stronger (use higher opacity like 0.4 instead of 0.1) because dark backgrounds absorb more light
  - Use `.dark` class selector to apply dark mode specific styles in Vue components
  - VitePress CSS variables for dividers: `--vp-c-divider` should be defined for both modes
  - Dark mode colors verified: `#0f172a` (slate-900) for background, `#f8fafc` (slate-50) for text
  - Code blocks in dark mode work well with VitePress default Shiki theme

  - `docs/.vitepress/theme/index.ts` (modified) - Registered HomePhilosophy as a global component
  - `docs/index.md` (modified) - Added HomePhilosophy component after HomeHero, before HomeFeatures
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Philosophy component was already created in a previous iteration but not committed; always verify git status before starting work
  - The 6 core principles are derived from SPEC.md Core Philosophy section plus Key Differentiators
  - Philosophy section uses a 3-column grid layout similar to HomeFeatures, transitioning to 2 columns on tablet and 1 on mobile
  - Section styling follows established patterns: centered title, muted subheading, grid of items with consistent card styling
