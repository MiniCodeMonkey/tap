# Ralph Progress Log
Started: Fri Jan 23 20:59:35 CET 2026

## Codebase Patterns
- VitePress config is at `docs/.vitepress/config.ts`
- Use `srcExclude: ['**/ralph/**']` to exclude development files from VitePress build
- VitePress validates TypeScript during build - no separate typecheck needed
- Build output goes to `docs/.vitepress/dist/`
- Dev server runs on port 5173 by default
- Custom theme files go in `docs/.vitepress/theme/` (index.ts + style.css)
- VitePress CSS variables use `--vp-c-*` prefix for colors, `--vp-font-family-*` for fonts
- Vue components go in `docs/.vitepress/theme/components/` and are registered in theme index.ts via `app.component()`

## 2026-01-23 - US-001
- What was implemented: Initialized VitePress project with basic configuration
- Files changed:
  - `docs/.gitignore` (created) - Excludes node_modules, cache, dist
  - `docs/.vitepress/config.ts` (modified) - Added srcExclude for ralph directory
  - `docs/index.md` (existing) - Placeholder landing page
  - `docs/package.json` (existing) - Has VitePress dev dependency and scripts
  - `docs/package-lock.json` (existing) - Lock file
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - VitePress was already partially set up; needed to add srcExclude to prevent build errors from ralph directory
  - The build validates TypeScript, so a separate typecheck command is not required
  - Must add .gitignore early to avoid committing node_modules
---

## 2026-01-23 - US-002
- What was implemented: Configured navigation and sidebar structure in VitePress
- Files changed:
  - `docs/.vitepress/config.ts` - Added nav array with 5 links (Getting Started, Guide, Reference, Examples, GitHub) and sidebar configuration for /guide/, /reference/, and /examples/ sections
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - VitePress sidebar uses path-based matching - sidebar configs keyed by `/guide/` only show on pages under that path
  - The `items: []` in sidebar groups can be empty (useful for examples section placeholder)
  - Nav links to sections should point to the first page in that section (e.g., `/guide/writing-slides` not just `/guide/`)
---

## 2026-01-23 - US-003
- What was implemented: Created all stub markdown files for documentation structure
- Files changed:
  - `docs/getting-started.md` (created) - Getting started page stub
  - `docs/guide/writing-slides.md` (created) - Guide stub
  - `docs/guide/layouts.md` (created) - Guide stub
  - `docs/guide/themes.md` (created) - Guide stub
  - `docs/guide/animations-transitions.md` (created) - Guide stub
  - `docs/guide/code-blocks.md` (created) - Guide stub
  - `docs/guide/live-code-execution.md` (created) - Guide stub
  - `docs/guide/presenter-mode.md` (created) - Guide stub
  - `docs/guide/images-media.md` (created) - Guide stub
  - `docs/guide/building-export.md` (created) - Guide stub
  - `docs/reference/cli-commands.md` (created) - Reference stub
  - `docs/reference/frontmatter-options.md` (created) - Reference stub
  - `docs/reference/slide-directives.md` (created) - Reference stub
  - `docs/reference/layouts-reference.md` (created) - Reference stub
  - `docs/reference/drivers.md` (created) - Reference stub
  - `docs/reference/keyboard-shortcuts.md` (created) - Reference stub
  - `docs/examples/index.md` (created) - Examples section stub
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - All stub pages follow the same pattern: YAML frontmatter with title, H1 heading matching title, brief description, and "*Content coming soon.*" placeholder
  - Directory structure mirrors the sidebar navigation configured in US-002
  - File names use kebab-case and match the sidebar link paths
---

## 2026-01-23 - US-004
- What was implemented: Set up custom VitePress theme with Linear-inspired styling
- Files changed:
  - `docs/.vitepress/theme/index.ts` (created) - Theme entry point extending default theme
  - `docs/.vitepress/theme/style.css` (created) - Custom CSS variables for colors and fonts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - VitePress custom themes go in `docs/.vitepress/theme/` directory
  - Theme index.ts must import DefaultTheme from 'vitepress/theme' and export it
  - CSS variables use `--vp-c-*` naming convention (e.g., `--vp-c-brand-1`, `--vp-c-bg`, `--vp-c-text-1`)
  - Dark mode is activated via `.dark` class selector on the root element
  - Font stacks use `--vp-font-family-base` for body and `--vp-font-family-mono` for code

## 2026-01-23 - US-005
- What was implemented: Created HomeHero component for the landing page
- Files changed:
  - `docs/.vitepress/theme/components/HomeHero.vue` (created) - Hero section component with headline, subheadline, install command, and CTA buttons
  - `docs/.vitepress/theme/index.ts` (modified) - Registered HomeHero as a global component
  - `docs/index.md` (modified) - Changed layout to `page` and added HomeHero component
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Vue components must be registered globally in theme index.ts using `app.component()` within `enhanceApp()`
  - Use `extends: DefaultTheme` instead of just exporting DefaultTheme when adding enhancements
  - Components directory is `docs/.vitepress/theme/components/`
  - Use `layout: page` in frontmatter to have a clean page with just nav and content (no sidebar)
  - CSS scoped styles in Vue components keep styles isolated from the rest of the site

## 2026-01-23 - US-006
- What was implemented: Added CopyButton component for one-click install command copying
- Files changed:
  - `docs/.vitepress/theme/components/CopyButton.vue` (created) - Reusable copy button with clipboard API integration and visual feedback
  - `docs/.vitepress/theme/components/HomeHero.vue` (modified) - Added CopyButton next to install command
  - `docs/.vitepress/theme/index.ts` (modified) - Registered CopyButton as a global component
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup lang="ts">` is cleaner for simple components
  - Use `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` for clipboard operations (async API)
  - SVG icons can be inlined in Vue templates for simple icons (copy icon, checkmark icon)
  - Use `ref()` for reactive state that controls UI (e.g., copied state for icon toggle)
  - setTimeout is fine for simple temporary state changes like copy feedback

## 2026-01-23 - US-007
- What was implemented: Created HomeFeatures component displaying three value proposition cards
- Files changed:
  - `docs/.vitepress/theme/components/HomeFeatures.vue` (created) - Features section with three cards showing Markdown-first, Live code execution, and Single binary value props
  - `docs/.vitepress/theme/index.ts` (modified) - Registered HomeFeatures as a global component
  - `docs/index.md` (modified) - Added HomeFeatures component below HomeHero
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Grid layouts work well with `grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr)` for even card distribution
  - Use responsive breakpoints at 768px to collapse to single column on mobile
  - Feature data can be stored as a simple array of objects in `<script setup>` for easy mapping
  - Use `var(--vp-c-bg-alt)` for subtle card backgrounds that work in both light and dark mode
---

## 2026-01-23 - US-008
- What was implemented: Created HomeCode component showing markdown example with terminal-style display
- Files changed:
  - `docs/.vitepress/theme/components/HomeCode.vue` (created) - Code example section with terminal window styling, showing frontmatter, SQL query with driver annotation, and descriptive text
  - `docs/.vitepress/theme/index.ts` (modified) - Registered HomeCode as a global component
  - `docs/index.md` (modified) - Added HomeCode component after HomeFeatures
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use Catppuccin-style colors (#1e1e2e, #181825, #cdd6f4) for terminal-like dark code blocks
  - Window controls (red/yellow/green dots) add visual polish and familiarity
  - Template strings in `<script setup>` work well for multi-line code examples
  - Use monospace font for both the code content and filename for consistency
---

## 2026-01-23 - US-009
- What was implemented: Created HomeThemes component displaying 5 theme preview cards in a grid
- Files changed:
  - `docs/.vitepress/theme/components/HomeThemes.vue` (created) - Theme grid section with 5 cards showing theme name, vibe description, and colored gradient preview
  - `docs/.vitepress/theme/index.ts` (modified) - Registered HomeThemes as a global component
  - `docs/index.md` (modified) - Added HomeThemes component after HomeCode
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use CSS gradients for abstract theme previews (more lightweight than images)
  - 5-column grid works well for 5 items; use `repeat(5, 1fr)` for even distribution
  - Responsive breakpoints: 5 columns at desktop, 2 at tablet (900px), 1 at mobile (480px)
  - Hover effects with `translateY` and `box-shadow` add subtle interactivity
  - Theme card structure: preview image area + info section with name and description
