## Codebase Patterns
- Frontend is Svelte 5 + TypeScript + Vite, located in `/frontend`
- Utility modules go in `frontend/src/lib/utils/`
- Tests use Vitest with `vi.mock()` for mocking, file pattern: `*.test.ts`
- Path alias `$lib` maps to `src/lib`
- Build output goes to `/embedded/dist` for Go embedding
- Typecheck command: `npm run check` (runs svelte-check + tsc)
- Go backend packages go in `internal/` directory
- Go tests use `*_test.go` pattern, run with `go test ./...`
- Themes are CSS files in `frontend/src/lib/themes/`
- Layouts are in `frontend/src/lib/styles/layouts.css`
- Example presentations are in `examples/` folder
- tap dev --headless runs server without TUI
